<!-- Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project. -->
<!--
 1. Firstly I used useState to store data from api in courses component.
 2. then passed that as props to course componenet to access and show those data.
 3. then created two new useState in app.jsx file to store for math functionality and passed as props to cart componenet to access and show those math.
 4. All of the state used in my project are on a single click event dependent,
